  # Description
  My motivation for making this project was to learn and show more about my study of routes using MongoDb.
  I built this mainly for extra practice on these topics.  
  This solves an issue with my in the hiring processes of jobs.  I have a lot of experience with SQL, but little with Mongo prior to this.
  I learned a lot about trying to set up a mongo database all together.  In addition, I learned a lot more about the use of insomnia when testing this.
  
  # Installation
  I built this by using the structure given in my assignment.  I was given the models and the end routes it was told to do.  After setting those up, I make the routes itself.  I then made seed data to put into the database to make testing easier, which admittedly cause a majority of my issues.
  
  # Usage
  This application can be used to show hiring managers my work on this topic.
  
  # Credits
  I worked on this project alone, with the framework provided from the the assignment instructions.

  This was not deployed anywhere, but I did test this in Insomnia.  Here is my a small screenshot of the routes I made.
